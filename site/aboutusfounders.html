                    Scott and Julie Brusaw met growing up in California when they were preschoolers. They founded Solar Roadways in 2006, and are now headquartered in Sandpoint, Idaho. The idea came to Julie out of concern for the environment, and Scott used his engineering skills to turn her vision into reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Scott is a veteran Marine Corps Ammunition Technician who later earned his M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Julie has an M.A in Counseling Psychology. Scott has worked on engineering projects in various U.S. states, Canada, and Italy.
                    <br><br>
                    Julie was a counselor in private practice for many years. She juggled both counseling and Solar Roadways until the demands of Solar Roadways became such that her full time attention was required. She enjoys all "people" aspects of Solar Roadways: meetings, social media, email, working with employees and talking to people at events. 
                    <br><br>
                    Scott loves the technology and working with his team to make it all happen. He also enjoys speaking to audiences about Solar Roadways.
                    <br><br>
                    Scott and Julie have grown children and a young granddaughter. They want more than anything to leave the world a better place for all of our children.
