                    The Solar Roadways® journey began on an ordinary day as most life changing adventures do. Scott and Julie had known each other since they were small children, in southern California in the 1960’s when roads and highways looked, well – just like they do today!
                    <br><br>
                    Years later, married and living in Idaho, Scott and Julie were working in their garden. We’d been reading Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth and were feeling very concerned about climate and environmental issues. Julie wondered aloud whether roads could be made out of solar panels. We’d been contemplating buying rooftop solar panels out of concern for the environment. Suddenly, an image popped into Julie’s mind of solar panels on the driveway and the road. She asked Scott’s opinion of this idea, but he just laughed and said that would be impossible – the fragile solar panels would be crushed by cars.
                    <br>
                    Julie dismissed the idea, but Scott’s engineering mind just couldn’t let it go. About a week later, he said, “If we can design a protective case, then you might be onto something about that solar roadway idea.” We decided to brainstorm. Many hours were spent on a couch getting more excited as realization after realization flowed into us:
                    <br><br>
                    “We could add heating elements and roads would always be snow free.”
                    <br>
                    “We could make road lines out of embedded LEDs.”
                    <br>
                    “This would generate SO much renewable energy.”
                    <br>
                    “Those ugly wires could go into some kind of compartment alongside the roads.”
                    <br>
                    “We could use the panels for parking lots too.”
                    <br>
                    “And sidewalks.”
                    <br>
                    “And driveways.”
                    <br><br>
                    On it went until we had written up a nice summary of the idea. We decided to present it to our friend and neighbor Dr. Pam Bird, author of the book, “Inventing for Dummies”, whose company had been advising inventors for many years. Pam thought the pursuit would be difficult, but ultimately could be very successful.
